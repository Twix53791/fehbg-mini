# fehbg-mini
A small command line interface to manage wallpapers.

Manage your background wallpapers in a minimal way. Randomize the picked one at boot with feh and change it quickly with fzf.

## Use/install

- .fehbg-random is a script which has to be launch at startup, for exemple from bspwmrc or .xinit... The file can be placed anywhere.

- fzfehbg can be put in /usr/local/bin to be easily launched from a terminal.

## Configure

Just edit the both files to change the wallpapers default directory (WP_DIR variable).
